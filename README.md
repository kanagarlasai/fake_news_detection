Fake News Detection using Machine Learning (ML), recognizing the escalating issue of misinformation on social media. The project's core objective is to combat the spread of fake news, particularly emphasizing its detrimental impact on public trust and belief manipulation. Introducing ML algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Descent, and Logistic Regression, the proposed system offers an efficient means of detecting fake and true news. Utilizing sample databases for training and testing, the project demonstrates the algorithms' accuracy through data preprocessing and manual testing, enabling users to input news for instant authenticity determination. In conclusion, the project provides a comprehensive approach to address fake news challenges in the realm of social media, bridging the gap between traditional and modern detection methods while acknowledging inherent limitations.
